# FutureStack GenAI Hackathon Submission Plan

## Eligibility: YES! ✅

DegenDancing is **absolutely eligible** for the FutureStack GenAI hackathon. Here's how we can compete in each track:

---

## Track Selection & Strategy

### 🎯🎯 DUAL TRACK STRATEGY (RECOMMENDED!)
**Combined: Cerebras + Meta Llama Tracks**  
**Total Prize Potential:** $10,000 + Interview + Coffee Chat  

**🚀 THE PERFECT COMBO:**
Use **Cerebras API** to run **Llama models** = Compete in BOTH tracks with ONE implementation!

Cerebras offers ultra-fast Llama inference, so you can showcase:
1. **Meta Llama Track**: Best use of Llama for impactful generative AI
2. **Cerebras Track**: Best use of Cerebras API for lightning-fast inference

**Our Winning Angle:** AI Dance Coach with Real-Time Feedback
- Cerebras-powered Llama for instant AI commentary (speed advantage)
- Ultra-fast challenge generation (sub-second responses)
- Real-time natural language move descriptions
- Scalable to 100+ simultaneous users

**Why This Dominates:**
- ✅ Compete for $10,000 in prizes (not just $5,000)
- ✅ Showcases Cerebras' speed advantage (measurable metrics)
- ✅ Demonstrates Llama's creative capabilities
- ✅ Clear technical innovation (fastest AI dance coach)
- ✅ Two submission opportunities with one codebase
- ✅ Cerebras has Llama models natively available!

**Available Llama Models on Cerebras:**
- `llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` (newest, ultra-fast)
- `llama-3.3-70b-instruct` (via OpenRouter + Cerebras provider)
- `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (fast responses)
- `llama-3.1-70b-instruct` (high quality)

---

### � ALTERNATIVE: Docker MCP Gateway Track
**Prize:** $5,000 Cash  
**Requirement:** Most creative use of Docker MCP Gateway

**Our Angle:** AI Agent Coordination for Dance Battles
- Use MCP Gateway to coordinate multiple AI dance agents
- Each agent evaluates performances from different angles
- Distributed verification system
- Agent consensus for fair scoring

**Why This Fits:**
- ✅ We already have Docker setup
- ✅ Creative use of MCP for AI coordination
- ✅ Sets up Phase 3 of roadmap (AI agents)
